## Instructions

Go ahead and clone down this repo using `git clone https://github.com/jkeane889/IBM_CodingChallenge.git`, and open
the 'challengeOne' file upon successful download.

In the 'challengeOne' file, you will be able to access the 'contains' function by following this filepath: 

'challengeOne -> src -> challengeOne.js'

After saving a copy of this repo locally, you can import 'challengeOne.js' manually into any other JavaScript file you would
like to run.

The function 'isDivisible' will take in three integers (n, p, q), which will print a sequence of integers from 1 to N inclusive, replacing any integer divisible by p whose decimal representation does not contain the digit p, replaced by the text WAT, and any integer divisible by q whose decimal representation does not contain the digit q, replaced by the text SON.

Integers for which both of the preceding statements are true should are replaced by the text WATSON.

## Tests

The tests over the 'contains' function are conducted in the 'SpecRunner.html' file, which utilizes the Jasmine test framework.

You can simply click the 'SpecRunner.html' file, which will open the file in your default browser, showing the status of
the tests over the 'contains' function.

The tests are comprehensive and test the 'contains' function based on its prototype, functionality and edge cases.
